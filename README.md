####Development
You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/) installed.

Prepare environment:
1. Build image: `fig build` (done only once, image rebuilding also needed if you need to update system packages or your Gemfile changed.
2. Initialize database: `fig run web bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate`

To start env: `fig up` <- this will run rails on 3000 port and postgres.
If you on Mac then you application port will be bind to VirtualBox IP, you can find get it here: `boot2docker ip`.

To run rake/rails tasks: `fig run web bundle exec rails g contoller Main` or `fig run web bundle exec rake routes`
